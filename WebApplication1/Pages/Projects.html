                    I made this because I wanted to start reading more books but didn't really know where to look.
                    <br> So I though why not just make a application that could do it. This will search for a book you type,
                    <br> and also give you a small description of what the book is about.

                    Solitaire was a game a played a lot as a kid, it's also a game play now when I'm bored.
                    <br> Just wondered how difficult it would be to mak it. At first it was hard but
                    <br> the more I continued coding it the more fun I had.

                    Growing up there wasn't much to do and back then and there wasn't that many games to play on a phone except one.
                    <br> The good ole snake game. This was really for nostalgia and I hope you all have fun playing it.
